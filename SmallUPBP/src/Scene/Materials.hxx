	 * There are two types of materials: real and imaginary. Geometry with a real
	 * material acts as expected, depending on its properties incident ray gets reflected
	 * or refracted. Geometry with an imaginary material is only a container for medium.
	 * Ray does not interact with its boundary at all. Type of a material is specified
	 * by geometry type property. Another important material property is priority. It is
	 * necessary in case of overlapping geometry with different materials for decision
	 * which of them is in effect. Following rules must be obeyed:
	 *  - no imaginary material can have greater priority than a real material
	 *  - no object with an imaginary material can intersect an object with a real material (but it can include it completely)
	 *  - materials of intersecting objects cannot have same priorities
